# How it work?

You just need to create the graph, place the information on the tape and click on the green button to simulate.

# Features

- Graphical analysis for better insights into computation.
- Visual pixel display for tape segments.
- Numeric display to represent binary numbers stored on the tape.
- Save and load machine states to continue work.
- Customize sounds for different machine states or actions.
- Generate code for other Turing machine applications, such as [Turing Machine Simulator](https://turingmachinesimulator.com/).
- Support for graph layout algorithms to visualize machine logic.
- Intuitive interface for designing and editing Turing machines.
- Real-time simulation with step-by-step execution and debugging tools.

# Execution

To run locally, just install `npm run install` and then `npm run dev`.
